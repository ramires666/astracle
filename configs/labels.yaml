# Oracle label config

labels:
  # Gaussian smoothing strength
  sigma: 3

  # Threshold mode:
  #   - "fixed": use threshold as-is
  #   - "auto": auto-pick threshold to target MOVE share
  threshold_mode: "auto"

  # Slope threshold (used when threshold_mode="fixed")
  threshold: 0.0005

  # Target MOVE share (|slope| > threshold) for auto mode
  target_move_share: 0.5

  # Optional clamps for auto threshold
  threshold_min: 0.0
  threshold_max: null

  # Price mode: "log" or "raw"
  price_mode: "raw"

  # Binary trend mode: treat sideways as continuation of previous direction
  binary_trend: false

  # If there is no prior direction, fallback to "up" or "down"
  binary_fallback: "up"

  # Prediction horizon (days)
  horizon: 1

  # Auto-pick sigma/threshold for DOWN vs UP balance (notebook)
  auto_grid_select: true
